        <h2>About Teacher Amy</h2>
        <p> <font color="black">Hi! My name is Amy, and I am a Cambridge certified English teacher from the United States. Welcome to English Prep Live!</font> </p>
        <p><font color="black">My passion for teaching English began while working as an English writing tutor at an American university. 
        I designed university level tutoring materials and taught one-to-one lessons to hundreds of students. I also taught several international students and helped 
        them perfect their English writing skills to maximize their experience studying at an English speaking university. 
        It was a great experience to be able to teach students from many parts of the world.
        I found that teachers can learn as much from their students as their students can from their teachers!
        After working as an English writing tutor, I extended my university studies in Sweden
        by studying multicultural communication at university.
        I met people from around the world and learned about many amazing cultures. After this experience, 
        I knew I wanted to teach English as a Foreign Language for my profession.</font></p>

      <p><font color="black">From Sweden I moved to Poland to begin my career as an English language teacher.  I received the Cambridge
      CELTA certification of Teaching English as a Foreign Language to Adults from the British Council in Krakow,
      Poland.  Afterward, I moved to beautiful Japan and taught one-to-one and group classes to students of all ages, 
      ranging from four to seventy-five years old. My students came from many different backgrounds.  Many of my 
      students were business professionals, professors, as well as students preparing to study at English speaking 
      universities.  I customized personal lessons in general and conversational English in addition to business English 
      and test preparation.

       questions you may have. I am here to help!

       <h1>My Teaching Involves The Following Objectives:</h1>
       <br> 
       <h3>Variety and Flexibility</h3> 
       <p>I understand that every student has their own learning style. Therefore my lessons are versatile and flexible. I use a
        variety of teaching methods and resources from games to media in order to cater to all learning styles.</p>
       
       <h3>Language Immersion</h3>
       <p>I find the fastest way to learn a language is by practicing thinking and interacting in that language. My lessons incorporate interactive
        activities and offer opportunities for lots and lots of speaking practice. </p>
        
       <h3>Creativity and Discovery</h3>
       <p>I believe that creativity and discovery are just as important as vocabulary and grammar, as it quickens the pace of learning.
       As a result, my lessons are fun, interactive and interesting. Each student will be their own explorer of the English language.
         </p>
         
        <h3>Communicative Meaning</h3>
       <p>We remember new material best when we can relate what we learn to our own lives. Therefore my lesson activities and conversation
        topics will be related to your life and goals.
         </p>
       
       <h3>Positive Feedback and Continuous Assessment</h3>
       <p>Your live lessons as well as post-lesson activities will be continually assessed by me to guarantee optimal progress. During the
        class I will make a list of any areas in need of improvement. These areas will then be addressed at the end of each lesson and reviewed during
         the beginning of your following lessons. Students will be given the opportunity to practice strengthening these areas during their post-lesson
          activity.
         </p>
